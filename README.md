# dronet-maincomputer

Main Computer is the main under the DroNet project, which is developed by 4th year aerospace engineering students. DroNet aims to create a system for locating, tracking, and intercepting hostile drones using a group of drones and a net. VISTRKR specifically focuses on the optical solution for locating and tracking the hostile drone using optical systems.

This repository contains the Python files that implement the algorithms for the mian computer. The code is designed to process visual and acustic data from optical systems, such as cameras or microphones, to accurately locate and track hostile drones in real-time. The algorithms are optimized for performance and accuracy.

That Repository is a Socket based wirelessly connection. it contain - creating the run log and combine two tracking systems together.
